## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## MODULE 04 CHALLENGES

## Challenge 1

```{r}

## First, I create a vector containing the words and I call it v
v <- c("Stately,","plump","Buck","Mulligan","came","from","the","stairhead,","bearing","a","bowl","of","lather","on","which","a","mirror","and","a","razor","lay","crossed.")

##With this function, I extract from x the elements from position 3 to position 3, which means I extract every third element
str_sub(x,3,3)

##This function is for removing punctuation and special characters from the string
gsub("[[:punct:]]","",x)


```


## Challenge 2

```{r}
## I create the matrix m
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)

## This creates a vector containing the values of the 2nd, 3rd and 6th column of the matrix m
x <- c(m[,2],m[,3],m[,6])
x

y <-
```
